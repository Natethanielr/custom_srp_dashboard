# Electricity Usage 

## Purpose 

The information I get from the srp dashboard is good, but I wanted more indepth information about electricity use. The goal of this project is to get a more substantial view of usage trends, identify days and times of above average usage, and create a plan to reduce electricty costs. 

## Structure

The jupyter notebook contains the base for this project. In that notebook, I explore trends and write the baseline code for the rest of the project. The accompanying python code is a cleaned up, streamlined code base to form the base of a dashboard.
